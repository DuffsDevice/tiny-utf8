### DESCRIPTION
**Tiny-utf8** is a library for extremely easy integration of Unicode into an arbitrary C++11 project.
The library consists solely of the class `utf8_string`, which acts as a drop-in replacement for `std::string`.
Its implementation is successfully in the middle between small memory footprint and fast access. All functionality of `std::string` is therefore replaced by the corresponding codepoint-based UTF-32 version - translating every access to UTF-8 under the hood.

#### FEATURES
- **Drop-in replacement for std::string**
- **Very Lightweight** (~2.5K SLOC)
- **Very fast**, i.e. highly optimized decoder, encoder and traversal routines
- **Advanced Memory Layout**, i.e. Random Access is
   - ***O(1) for ASCII-only strings (!)*** and
   - O("#Codepoints > 127") for the average case.
   - O(n) for strings with a high amount of non-ASCII code points
- **Small String Optimization** (SSO) for strings up to an UTF8-encoded length of `sizeof(utf8_string)`! That is, including the trailing `\0`
- **Growth in Constant Time** (Amortized)
- **Conversion between UTF32 and UTF8**
- Small Stack Size, i.e. `sizeof(utf8_string)` = 16 Bytes (32Bit) / 32 Bytes (64Bit)
- Codepoint Range of `0x0` - `0xFFFFFFFF`, i.e. 1-7 Code Units/Bytes per Codepoint (Note: This is more than specified by UTF8, but until now otherwise considered out of scope)
- ***NEW:** Single Header File*
- Straightforward C++11 Design
- Possibility to prepend the UTF8 BOM (Byte Order Mark) to any string when converting it to an std::string
- Supports raw (Byte-based) access for occasions where Speed is needed.
- Supports `shrink_to_fit()`
- Malformed UTF8 sequences will **lead to defined behaviour**

## THE PURPOSE OF TINY-UTF8
Back when I decided to write a UTF8 solution for C++, I knew I wanted a drop-in replacement for `std::string`. At the time mostly because I found it neat to have one and felt C++ always lacked accessible support for UTF8. Since then, several years have passed and the situation has not improved much. That said, things currently look like they are about to improve - but that doesn't say much, does it?

The opinion shared by many "experienced Unicode programmers" (e.g. published on [UTF-8 Everywhere](utf8everywhere.org)) is that "non-experienced" programmers both *under* and *over*estimate the need for Unicode- and encoding-specific treatment: This need is...
  1. **overestimated**, because many times we really should care less about codepoint/grapheme borders within string data;
  2. **underestimated**, because if we really want to "support" unicode, we need to think about *normalizations*, *visual character comparisons*, *reserved codepoint values*, *illegal code unit sequences* and so on and so forth.

Unicode is not rocket science but nonetheless hard to get *right*. **Tiny-utf8** does not intend to be an enterprise solution like [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org/) for C++. The goal of **tiny-utf8** is to
  - bridge as many gaps to "supporting Unicode" as possible by 'just' replacing `std::string` with a custom class which means to
  - provide you with a Codepoint Abstraction Layer that takes care of the Run-Length Encoding, without you noticing.

**Tiny-utf8** aims to be the simple-and-dependable groundwork which you build Unicode infrastructure upon. And, if *1)* C++2a should happen to make your Unicode life easier than **tiny-utf8** or *2)* you decide to go enterprise, you have not wasted much time replacing `std::string` with `utf8_string` either. This is what makes **tiny-utf8** so agreeable.

#### WHAT TINY-UTF8 IS NOT AIMED FOR
- Conversion between ISO encodings and UTF8
- Interfacing with UTF16
- Visible character comparison (`'ch'` vs. `'c'+'h'`)
- Codepoint Normalization
- Correction of invalid Code Unit sequences

Note: ANSI suppport was dropped in Version 2.0 in favor of execution speed.

## EXAMPLE USAGE

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <tinyutf8.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    utf8_string str = u8"!üåç olleH";
    for_each( str.rbegin() , str.rend() , []( char32_t codepoint ){
      cout << codepoint;
    } );
    return 0;
}
```

## BUILD MODES

Since Version 3, **tiny-utf8** is header-only, i.e. *tinyutf8.h* includes all definitions and one doesn't need to build *tinyutf8.cpp* separately. If you want to speed up your compilation time with a large number of source files, include *tinyutf8.hpp* instead, which `#define`s `TINY_UTF8_FORWARD_DECLARE_ONLY` and then includes *tinyutf8.h*, which now has all definitions removed.

Subsequently, in order to build the definitions in *tinyutf8.h* in a separate source file, add *tinyutf8.cpp* to your source files, which only includes *tinyutf8.h* (instead of *tinyutf8.h**pp***).

## BUGS

I'll try to answer it soon!
