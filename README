Thank You for downloading tinyutf8!
Include "tinyutf8.h" in your project and
add "tinyutf8.cpp" to the projects source files.

If there are any bugs or you want to add features,
such as the wstring::rfind method for substrings,
don't hesitate to do so (You should have write
access to the svn in sourceforge :D )!

Have fun!
